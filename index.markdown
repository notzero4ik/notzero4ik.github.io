hello, i am notzero4ik, pretty stupid developer. I have many hobbies like reverse-engineering, backend developing, creating useful tools and recently i started trying game-dev more. I live in Russia and I am 14 years old. I started learning C++ in 11 and then i started rapidly learning other languages. Even although I catch myself every time on just dropping new project, I have a few working projects (many of them are still developing :) )!
